        <h2>The best cheesecake you'll ever bake</h2>
        <p>This recipe is an adaptation of <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8350/chantals-new-york-cheesecake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chantal's New York Cheesecake</a> 
            with a few modifications and additional tips I've learned while making it.
            Chief among them is the use of a crushed chocolate wafer crust instead of graham crackers.
        </p>
        <h3>Required ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>200 grams</strong> crushed chocolate wafers or chocolate graham crackers</li>
            <li><strong>2 Tbsp</strong> butter, melted</li>
            <li><strong>4 (8 oz)</strong> packages cream cheese <strong>(32 oz total)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>300 grams</strong> granulated white sugar</li>
            <li><strong>Â¾ cup</strong> milk</li>
            <li><strong>4 eggs</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> sour cream</li>
            <li><strong>30 grams</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan.</strong>
                <p>
                    During this time, or up to an hour before, it's recommended you take your refrigerated 
                    ingredients out of the fridge. Measure and set them aside on the counter to warm up.
                    You want all of your ingredients to be at room temperature when it's time to start mixing.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mix your chocolate crumbs with the melted butter.</strong>
                <p>
                    Any method you use to crush the wafers or crackers is fine.
                    A food processor is the easiest and gives fairly consistent results, but putting them in a bag
                    and crushing them with a rolling pin works just as well.  You want the result to be similar to the size of
                    Grape Nuts or smaller. Just don't go all the way until it's powder.
                </p>  
                <p> Microwaving the butter to melt it is just fine. Once combined, the mixture will still look dry,
                    but the crumbs will get a bit darker. Keep mixing until there are no large clumps or changes in the overall darkness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is one step where you can freestyle with amounts a bit.  If you like a thick crust, feel free to add more wafers and butter.
                    If you like a thinner crust, you can just leave some of the crust mixture out of the pan.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Press crumb mixture onto the bottom of prepared pan</strong>
                <p>
                    Any cooking spray works just fine, as does butter.  Just make sure you completely cover the bottom and the sides of the springform pan.
                    If you have paper rounds that fit into the closed springform pan, they're nice to have, but usually they're <em>just</em> too big 
                    to fit inside once the spring is shut.It's up to you whether the hassle of trimming a paper round is better or worse
                    than the marginal protection they give to the bottom of the crust when serving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a hamburger press, that can be a godsend when you're trying to press the crust
                    into the bottom of your pan.  Don't be afraid to use some force, you want that sucker secure to prevent crumbling.
                    Otherwise, any flat rigid spatula should work fine, just try to make the thickness as uniform as you can get it.
                </p>
                <p>In a pinch, a standard 9-inch cake pan will work alright, but it's a real hassle to get your slices out of it.
                    Most likely every slice you serve from a standard cake pan will fall apart.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Once the oven is preheated, bake the crust for 15-20 minutes.</strong>
                <p>
                    If you're just using normal graham crackers as the crust you can safely skip this step.
                   In my experience, failing to partially bake a chocolate crust before the normal baking of 
                    the cheesecake results in a disappointingly soggy and soft crust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After baking the crust, depending on your oven, it might be worth turning the oven off and back on again at the same temp.
                    This just helps to ensure the oven gets back up to the proper temp after losing heat from the open door when you removed the crust.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fill an oven-safe baking dish with water and place on the bottom rack of the oven</strong>
                <p>
                    This is a step that helps the cheesecake from drying out too much in the oven, and improves the odds you walk away without a crack on the top.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mix cream cheese and sugar together in a large bowl until smooth.</strong>
                <p>
                    This is the point at which having room temperature ingredients becomes crucial.
                    Cold cream cheese is orders of magnitude more difficult to mix, and will likely result in clumps or overmixing (or both).
                    Whether by hand or stand mixer, avoid mixing any more than you need to get the cream cheese combined with the sugar
                    and smooth.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Blend in milk, then mix in eggs, one at a time, until just combined.</strong>
                <p>
                    It's hard to overstate the importance of not overmixing with this recipe.  Overmixing introduces a lot more air than there
                    should be, which results in a cheesecake that cracks on the surface, and has a grainy unpleasant texture in the middle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <em>second</em> the milk is mostly combined and there aren't distinct pools of milk in the bowl, add the eggs one at a time.
                    Adding all the eggs at once can have bad effects on the texture of the cake, as the ingredients don't really incorporate and mingle the way they're supposed to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just to drill in the importance: <strong>DON'T MIX THE FILLING ANY MORE THAN IT TAKES TO INCORPORATE EACH EGG!</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add sour cream, flour, and vanilla. Mix until smooth.</strong>
                <p>
                    Same rules as last step apply, you want to mix it as little as possible to combine. Luckily by this step the additional
                    ingredients are much easier to incorporate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pour filling onto prepared crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.</strong>
                <p>
                    An optional step which also helps to prevent cracks on the top is to get a sheet of aluminum foil, and make a loose tent over the top of the pan. You don't want a tight seal.
                    Just bend the sheet over the top to get it to the general shape, then pull out a little slack around the edges so there's at least some ventilation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take care to keep the pan level as you put it in the oven, it's basically a liquid at this point. Try to be as fast as you can without spilling
                    while the oven's open, you really don't want to lose that heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you put the cheesecake in and close the oven door, don't open it for any reason.  <strong>NOT FOR ANY REASON!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>I mean it, don't open it to check the progress. <em>Don't do it.</em></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Turn the oven off; let cheesecake cool in the oven with the door closed for 6 hours to prevent cracking. Chill in the refrigerator until serving.</strong>
                <p>
                    Seriously, <em>DO NOT</em> open the oven door during this time, and keep it closed the full 6 hours.  The center of the cheesecake is still basically raw at this point,
                    and the residual heat in the oven gradually finishes the center without overcooking the outer part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the center of the cheesecake is still a little wobbly after waiting in the oven, don't worry; that may or may not happen.  All of your ingredients are safely cooked at this point
                    and a night in the refrigerator works to solidify everything nice and firm.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Serving</h3>
        <p>
            Once the cheesecake has had plenty of time to rest and cool in the fridge, all you have to do is take off the springform side, cut, and serve. This is where you'll really be patting yourself
            on the back for using a springform pan, or regretting your choice to use a standard cake pan.
        </p>

            This cheesecake tastes absolutely great on its own, but if you want to punch it up a bit more, try <a href="./strawberry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this recipe for strawberry sauce</a> , or add literally anything that strikes your fancy.
            There's not too many things that taste bad with cheesecake, but a slightly tart fruit sauce can really bring a fantastic balance to the taste.
