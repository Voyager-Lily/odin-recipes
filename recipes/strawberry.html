        <p>This recipe goes great on cheesecake, pancakes, cake, or anything else you might put syrup or fruit sauce on.  It's simple and a little tart, and compliments very rich desserts quite well.</p>
        <h3>Required ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 lb. </strong>Strawberries, rinsed, hulled, and thickly sliced</li>
            <li><strong>⅓ cup </strong>granulated white sugar</li>
            <li><strong>1 Tbsp </strong>lemon juice <strong>(½ fresh lemon squeezed)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Wash, hull, and slice strawberries</strong>
                <p>
                    Make sure they're nice and clean, with all of the leaves, and most of the top removed.
                    You want the strawberries to look like little hollow cups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're feeling a little lazy, you can get away with just slicing the whole top,
                    just enough to get rid of all of the stem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You want to slice them around ¼-⅓ inch thick, or around there. Still fairly thick, you should be looking to get maybe 3-6 slices per strawberry, depending on the size. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>In a medium saucepan: combine sliced strawberries, lemon juice, and sugar, bring to a boil, stirring occasionally</strong>
                <p>
                    Don't worry about mashing the slices, they'll release plenty of juice on their own with heat and time. Just move them around so the ones against the bottom don't burn.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Reduce heat and simmer 20-23 minutes or until sauce is thickened, stirring occasionally</strong>
                <p>
                    Sauce should be a little thinner than the viscosity of maple syrup.  If it still acts like water if you give the pan a little swirl,
                    give it another 2-3 minutes simmering at a time until it's done.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature</strong>
                <p>
                    The sauce will get thicker as it cools, especially if you refrigerate it before serving.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
