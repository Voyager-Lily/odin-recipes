        <h2>Pommes Dauphine without the deep fryer</h2>
        <p>
            A riff on the classic deep-fried French recipe of Pommes Dauphine, these potato puffs are baked in the oven,
            making them accesible for anyone to make! Somewhere between baked potato and pastry, they have a wonderful
            texture and a terrific flavor!

        <h3>Required ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4 </strong>small Yukon gold potatoes, cleaned and quartered</li>
            <li><strong>½ cup </strong>water</li>
            <li><strong>¼ cup </strong>butter</li>
            <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
            <li><strong>60 grams </strong>flour</li>
            <li><strong>2 </strong>large eggs</li>
            <li><strong>1 pinch </strong>cayenne pepper</li>
            <li><strong>1 pinch </strong>freshly grated nutmeg</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F, butter 24 mini muffin cups</strong>
                <p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Place quartered potatoes in a large lot, add enough salted water to cover them</strong>
                <p>
                    You're safe to add a liberal shake of salt to the water, around 2-3 tablespoons.
                    Use the cheap salt, most of it's going out with the water
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 15 minutes</strong>
                <p>
                    You'll know the potatoes are done if a knife can go in cleanly and easily. You don't want them
                    totally crumbly.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Drain and mash the potatoes, set aside</strong>
                <p>
                    You don't want the potatoes absolutely piping hot for the next step, so if you can,
                    try to use a fairly big mixing bowl, and spread the potatoes out as best you can inside it.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Combine water and butter in a saucepan over medium heat and season with salt. 
                Heat until butter melts and starts to bubble. Stir in flour until mixture pulls away from the 
                pan and comes together into a dough.</strong>
                <p>
                    Try to spread the flour as evenly as possible over the water to minimize clumping
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Transfer pastry dough to a bowl. Spread in the bowl and let cool, about 5 minutes. 
                Mix in eggs using a spatula until dough is very soft and sticky. </strong>
                <p>
                    You only want the dough warm, otherwise it will cook the egg yolks before they can properly incorporate, ruining the texture.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add 2 cups of the mashed potatoes and mix until well combined. Add a pinch of salt, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg. Give it one last mix.</strong>
                <p>
                    You don't want to massively overmix it, but the danger isn't nearly as severe as it might be for a cheesecake or souffle.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Scoop potato dough into the greased muffin cups; bake for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed.</strong>
                <p>
                    Let them rest for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack.  Let them cool 5 minutes more from there.  Trust me on that one.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Serving</h3>
        <p>
            This dish goes well anywhere, but truly shines beside a nicely seared steak. Use it any time you would serve another hot potato dish, 
            or simply paired with a savory dipping sauce as an appetizer or hors d'oeuvres.
