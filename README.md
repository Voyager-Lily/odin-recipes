# odin-recipes
First HTML project for The Odin Project
This project is a way to practice, and demonstrate proficiency in, the basics of HTML, git, version control, commit messages, shell commands, directory manipulation, and ability to write legible code.

I probably went a little overboard with the commit messages, but I wanted some practice writing semi-acceptable ones by the time I need to write them for real.  I feel I've demonstrated basic competency in the skills and technologies required to write and publish a basic HTML webpage.
